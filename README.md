# Simple-Stable-marriage-implementation-in-python

This is a simple python implementation of the stable matching algorithm. This implementation is based on the pseudocode from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gale%E2%80%93Shapley_algorithm. The main idea behind the algorithm is it aims to match 2 entities from 2 different lists according to preferences. In our case we  used an example of (n)boys matching to (n)girls.
